## FAQ

#### Are the projects your own?


The solutions are my own, however, 
the projects are given by the FrontEnd Mentor page for practice purposes. 
Some projects are out of the repository because they are already deployed, 
and making the site change would be very complicated and meaningless because, 
in the end, they are already deployed.

#### Are all the projects here?

As said before, some are outside this repository in their own, 
here will be projects made with basic technologies such as HTML, CSS and JS (Vanilla), some projects made with simple APIs/Libraries and the Tailwind framework. 
Any other project that involves some framework or a larger stack will have its own repository.
